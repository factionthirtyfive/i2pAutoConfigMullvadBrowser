# i2pAutoConfigMullvadBrowser

AutoConfig Files for i2p sync with Mullvad Browser

What does it do?
- All connection settings are pre-configured.
- Security level is "highest" as default but can be changed for current session.
- .I2P TLD is added. - So you don't have to add "http://" to every eepsite link.
- https-only mode disabled.
- The browser won't upgrade http to https - which not needed for eepsites.
- Search engine(s) adjusted for I2P.
